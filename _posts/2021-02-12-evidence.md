When these plates move, the land above them moves with them. We know this because of all the natral dissasters/occurances happen alongside. Scientists have mapped these tectonic plates and we can see where each tectonic plate collides with eachother. These tectonic plates float on the mantle.

If we take earthquakes and put all the earthquakes from 1900 to preasent we can see some similarities with the tectonic plates and the earthquakes

Lets take a look at all the volcanic eruptions too.

These volanic eruptions align with the tectonic plate's boarders too
