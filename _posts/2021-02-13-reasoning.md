When the tectonic plates shift/collide diffrent aspects of the land change. When they push against eachother, they create mountains and volcanos. When they slide against eachother they cause earthquakes. When they move apart they cause a divergent boundary to occur and seafloor spreading occurs. Seafloor spreading is the creation of new crust in the earth.
In conclusion tectonic plates do change the land they interact with. Volcanos, Earthquakes, Mountains, and divergent boundary's are all dependent on tectonic movement.
